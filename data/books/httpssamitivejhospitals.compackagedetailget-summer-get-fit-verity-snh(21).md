Physical Assessment and Rehabilitation Programs for Athletes

Before Fit Program: Physical Assessment for Athletes

What is the Before Fit Program?

A cardiovascular and general health screening program aimed at runners
and athletes, the Before Fit Program is used to analyze the fitness of a
runner, athlete or sports enthusiast before they compete or participate
in their chosen sport or a running event. Should a condition or
irregularity be detected during this pre-activity analysis, especially a
heart disorder, it means the athlete could be placing himself/herself at
risk of a serious health event or even death which can occur without
warning during exercise. Moreover, screening results can be used to
design a tailored training regimen as well as instill confidence prior
to competition.

Which groups are suited to the Before Fit Program?

Runners preparing for a long-distance race, such as races covering a
distance of 10km or more.

Runners and athletes wishing to undergo screening prior to the start of
a training regime.

Sports enthusiasts who are interested in finding out more about their
bodies before beginning an exercise regime.
